# Basic Prompting

All you need to instruct model to perform a task is a prompt. A prompt is a piece of text that you give to the model to perform a task. 

For example, if you want to summarize an article, you could simply write the prompt with the article text on the top and the prompt:

```
Long article text here .............
....................................

Summarize the above article for me.
```

Or if you want to translate a sentence from English to French, you could simply write the prompt with the English sentence on the top and the prompt:

```
This is a sentence in English.

Translate the above sentence to French.
```

Or if you want to generate a new text, you could simply write the prompt with the instructions and the model will give you the text.

```
Write me an introductory guide about Prompt Engineering.
```

However, using plain text as prompts i.e. without using any best practices you may not be able to fully utilise the power of LLMs. That's where "Prompt Engineering" or knowing the best practices for writing better prompts and getting the most out of LLMs comes in.
