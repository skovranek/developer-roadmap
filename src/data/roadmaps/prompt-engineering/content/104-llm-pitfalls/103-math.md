LLMs struggle with math. While they may have improved in solving simple math problems; they, however, coming up short when solving more complex math problems when minor semantic variation happens. This is particularly relevant in terms of mathematical reasoning. Despite advancements, they often fail at solving simple math problems and are unable to handle more complex ones effectively. Studies show that LLMs rely heavily on pattern recognition rather than genuine logical reasoning, leading to significant performance drops when faced with minor changes in problem wording or irrelevant information. This highlights a critical limitation in their reasoning capabilities.
