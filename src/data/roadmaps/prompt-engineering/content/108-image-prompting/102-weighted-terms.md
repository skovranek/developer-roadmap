# Weighted Terms

Weighted terms in image prompting are a technique used to control the output of AI-generated images by _emphasizing_ or _de-emphasizing_ certain words or phrases within a prompt. This method influences the model's focus and the resulting image. Models like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney allow users to assign weights to terms, which can significantly alter the generated image. For example, using (`mountain:1.5`) would emphasize the mountain aspect in an image prompt. Positive weights increase emphasis on desired elements, while negative weights de-emphasize or exclude elements. The placement of terms in the prompt also affects their influence, with words at the beginning generally having more impact. Adjusting weights often requires multiple attempts to achieve the desired result, and overemphasis on certain terms may limit creativity and diversity in generated images.
