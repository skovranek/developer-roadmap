# Quality Boosters

Quality boosters in AI image generation are techniques and tools used to enhance the visual output of generated images. These include advanced model architectures, use of natural and descriptive language in prompts, resolution specifications, AI image enhancers, style modifiers, iterative feedback, and experimentation with prompt lengths. Advanced models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 offer improved customization, while incorporating descriptive terms and specifying high resolutions can enhance detail and appeal. Currennt AI image tools as can upscale and refine images. Adding style-related terms and implementing feedback loops for refinement can lead to more personalized results. By employing these strategies, users can significantly improve the quality of AI-generated images, achieving more detailed, aesthetically pleasing, and tailored outputs.
