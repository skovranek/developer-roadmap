# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data processing. It acts as a message broker, allowing systems to publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a distributed commit log. Kafka is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data with low latency, making it ideal for real-time analytics, log aggregation, and data integration. It features topics for organizing data streams, partitions for parallel processing, and replication for fault tolerance, enabling reliable and efficient handling of large-scale data flows across distributed systems.
