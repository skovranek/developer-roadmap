# What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications by isolating them into lightweight, portable containers. Containers are standalone executable units that encapsulate all necessary dependencies, libraries, and configuration files required for an application to run consistently across various environments.
