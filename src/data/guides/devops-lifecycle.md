![Learn the key phases of the DevOps lifecycle.](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/key-phases-of-devops-lifecycle-788fa.jpg)

Whether you’re an experienced DevOps engineer or trying to expand your expertise, you’ll likely adopt (or are already using) parts of the **7 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle** as a core **process** for developing, testing, and deploying software projects.

But what are these phases, and do they really need to be followed in a specific order to truly matter?

As a [DevOps engineer](https://roadmap.sh/devops), your primary role is to help the development and operations teams operate better. You’ll do this by collaborating closely with software engineers, quality assurance teams, and other stakeholders to set up **processes**, implement tools, and create standards to achieve the overall goal of the project.

In this guide, you’ll learn about these phases, how they're implemented, and the sequence in which they are applied in software development.

**TL;DR:** 7 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle are:

- Continuous development
- Continuous integration (CI)
- Continuous testing
- Continuous deployment (CD)
- Continuous monitoring
- Continuous feedback
- Continuous operations

Let’s look at the DevOps lifecycle in detail.

## What is the DevOps lifecycle?

DevOps lifecycle is a set of stages that software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams use to deliver software applications in an efficient and reliable manner. It is a continuous and iterative process that facilitates integration and collaboration between these teams.

In traditional software development, developers don’t just build and deploy applications. They must also accommodate changes, fix bugs, consider feature requests, and handle various administrative tasks. The same approach to continuous improvement applies in DevOps, which has led to industries adopting DevOps to factor in the lifecycle processes into their operations.

The primary goal of the DevOps lifecycle is to streamline your development and delivery process and ensure applications are reliable and efficiently deployed.

It follows a range of continuous development, integration, testing, monitoring, and feedback gathering, with each section using sets of best practices and tools to ensure the overall project goal.

## 7 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle

The 7 key phases of the DevOps lifecycle, also known as the 7 C’s of DevOps, are sets of interconnected stages that work together in a continuous loop to help you develop, test, and deploy applications quickly. Below are the key phases of the DevOps lifecycle:

### 1. Continuous development

This phase is about planning and coding the software application. Developers plan the software and break the entire development process into smaller cycles that add value to the overall software development goal.

![Continuous Development](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-development-xbxj3.png)

By following this process, DevOps teams can easily map out the **software development lifecycle (SLDC)** to other stakeholders regarding expectations, responsibilities, and timelines. Additionally, because the development teams, testers, and other stakeholders build software piece-by-piece, the development process is fast, large-scale risk is minimal, and the process can easily adapt to changing requirements and business needs.

**Tools used for continuous development**

1. **Planning:** DevOps teams use project management tools like Jira, Linear, and ClickUp to help teams plan, track, and release software.

2. **Coding**: DevOps teams can use version control systems like Git, editors like Visual Studio Code, and pair programming tools like Tuple to effectively collaborate with other development teams when building software.

### 2. Continuous integration (CI)

After writing the code and storing it in a shared repository, DevOps teams can set up a CI pipeline on the repository so that when developers commit changes to the source code, they can do the following:

- Detect changes to existing code and initiate actions like unit testing, integration testing, and the build process.
- Perform code quality analysis.
- Generate deployment artifacts.

![Continuous Integration](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-integration-b4lef.png)

This is particularly important because the development team will continue to push updates into the source code to build new features, fix bugs, perform code improvement, and refactoring.

**Tools used**

Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions are some automation tools DevOps teams use to build, test, and deploy code changes.

### 3. Continuous testing

Continuous testing involves automating tests on the developed code to ensure that changes are validated at each step of the development cycle, catch defects, and provide feedback without the need for human intervention.

![Continuous testing](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-testing-d90gb.png)

If an error or bug occurs, the code is returned to the previous phase (integration) for correction and possible fixes. Automated testing improves the overall workflow by saving time and resources.

**Tools used**

Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, and Cucumber are some automation testing tools that DevOps teams use to automate testing at scale.

### 4. Continuous deployment (CD)

This is the phase when the codes that have passed all tests are automatically deployed to the staging or production environment. Continuous deployment's overall goals are:

- Reduce the time between development and deployment.
- Facilitate the deployment of finished code to production servers.
- Ensure consistency across development, testing, staging, and production environments.

![Continuous Deployment](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-deployment-bprfv.png)

**Tools used**

1. **Configuration tools**: The DevOps team uses configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack to automate the provisioning, configuration, management, and continuous delivery of IT infrastructure. These tools help the DevOps team increase efficiency, maintain consistency across environments, and reduce errors.

2. **Containerization and orchestration tools**: The DevOps team uses tools like [Docker](https://roadmap.sh/docker), Vagrant, and [Kubernetes](https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes) to build and test applications. These tools help applications respond to demand (scaling up and scaling down) and maintain consistency across environments.

### 5. Continuous monitoring

This is the phase where you keep an eye on the deployed application to monitor performance, security, and other helpful data. It involves the collection of metrics and other application usage-related data to detect issues such as system errors, server downtime, application errors, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it involves collaboration with the operation teams to monitor bugs and identify improper system behavior.

![Continuous Monitoring](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-monitoring-cydj0.png)

Continuous monitoring improves the productivity and reliability of the system while reducing IT support costs. Any issues detected during this phase can be promptly reported and addressed in the continuous development phase, creating a more efficient feedback loop.

**Tools used**

Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Datadog are some tools DevOps teams use to continuously monitor the application and infrastructure to identify and resolve issues.

### 6. Continuous feedback

Continuous feedback is about gathering information from users and stakeholders to understand how the software performs in real-life scenarios. The feedback is then continuously analyzed and used to make informed decisions and improve the overall development process.

![Feedback](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-feedback-eg1tr.png)

**Tools used**

DevOps teams use tools like Datadog and LogRocket to gather and gain insights into how users interact with their products.

### 7. Continuous operations

In the traditional software development process, developers might need to pull down the server when they want to update and maintain applications. This approach disrupts the development process, potentially increases organizational costs, and can lead to user service interruptions.

![Continuous operations](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/continuous-operations-h2yrj.png)

Continuous operations address these challenges, among others. It ensures the software remains available and operational with minimal downtime. This phase involves tasks such as:

- Performing zero-downtime deployments.
- Automating backups and recovery.
- Using infrastructure management to provision and scale resources.
- Distributing traffic across multiple servers to maintain performance during updates or high-traffic periods.
- Implementing strategies like database replication and rolling updates to maintain data availability.

**Tools used**

Puppet, Terraform, and Chef are some tools DevOps teams use to automate resource provisioning and ensure system reliability.

The DevOps lifecycle is a continuous process that involves development, integration, testing, deployment, monitoring, feedback, and operations. Beyond the improvement it brings, you’ll also notice that organizations are extending DevOps and further advancing its capability.

Let’s explore some of these extensions and how they’re changing the development process.
